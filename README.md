# MSKORUS - portfolio page remaster

Remaster of my official portfolio page. Now it is based on Next.js, TailwindCSS and TypeScript. WebGL scene was made with React Three Fiber and GLTF models made in Blender, then converted to JSX coponents for better manipulation.

Mobile and Destkop version of WebGL scene differs - for better performance, Mobile scene uses other avaliable "glasslike" material and less effects are applied.

### HOW IT'S MADE?

Mainly this site is based on:

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei
- @react-three/postprocessing
- gltfjsx
- GLTF models exported from Blender

But also I used some packages like:

- react-intersection-observer
- react-device-detect
- react-icons
- @emailjs/browser
- react-toastify
- aos

### TODO

- better WebGL background text
