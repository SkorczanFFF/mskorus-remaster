# MSKORUS - portfolio page remaster

Remaster of my official portfolio page. Now it is based on Next.js, TailwindCSS and WebGL scene made with React Three Fiber and some Blender models.

### HOW IT'S MADE?

Mainly this site is based on:

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- React Three Fiber
- models exported from Blender

But also I used some packages like:

- react-icons
- gltfjsx
- and more like @drei and postprocessing for WebGL scene

### STORY BEHIND THIS

In the last year of studying I was introduced to Three.js. As a React fan I decided to combine these two technologies into one page.
